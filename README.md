# Google Docs chat overhaul

## Usage
Post in chat:
- `ffz:<emote-id>`: emote from [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticons/)
- `img:{<url-without-https://>}`: image. Still in development as google docs's chat reformats any full URL as a hyperlink.

Examples:

`ffz:162146` will post [AYAYA](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/162146-AYAYA) emote.

`img:{files.catbox.moe/u75ar8.png}` will post a screenshot of me editing this readme.

## Installation

1. Grab latest release from [releases](https://github.com/xoko14/gdocs-chat-emotes/releases/latest)
2. Extract release somewhere (it needs to be kept there).
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` (should work for any chromium-based web browser)
4. Enable developer mode.
5. Click _Load unpacked_ and select extracted folder.
