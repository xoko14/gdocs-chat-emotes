# Google Docs chat overhaul

## Usage
Post in chat:
- `ffz:<emote-id>`: emote from [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/)
- `img:{<url-without-https://>}`: image. Still in development as google docs's chat reformats any full URL as a hyperlink.

Examples:

`ffz:162146` will post [AYAYA](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/162146-AYAYA) emote.

`img:{files.catbox.moe/u75ar8.png}` will post a screenshot of me editing this readme.
